### Abstract:
This thesis focuses on exploring Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)
in respect to time series data distributions. Knowledge about image generating
DDPMs is used to create Time Series DDPMs that are capable of synthesizing
time series data. Different statistical, visual metrics as well as an applicative test
are introduced to evaluate the quality of the generative models. In conducting
this applicative test, not only is the quality of the models further measured, but
also the investigation is carried out to determine whether a trained DDPM can
perform in a continual learning environment.

### Intuition: 
Taking DDPM and training them to synthesize time series data.
