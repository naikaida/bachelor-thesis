DDPMs emerged first in a thermodynamic context \cite{sohl-dickstein_deep_2015} and were improved and developed since then. 
Publications like \cite{ho_denoising_2020}, \cite{dhariwal_diffusion_2021} and \cite{nichol_improved_2021} were published in 
less than a year from one another and laid the foundation for many popular applications today. It is a rather young field of research and 
major breakthroughs occur regularly. The main focus of the majority of research paper regarding DDPM focus on the domain of image data and computer vision.
Searching for specific DDPM models that work with time series data is most of the time not met with success. Still there are many different approaches for utilization of DDPM in the context of time series data. For example found in \cite{rasul2021autoregressive} as an autoregressive approach for time series forecasting.
